## Assignment1

In this assignment, I plotted the histogram for the age distribution. I learned various concepts from google(stackoverflow), like fitting data to Un-Normalised Gaussian distribution and plotting with histograms. Read about the one sample KS Test and Anderson-Darling Test, understood the interpretation of results.

For the other Distributions i took help from Vishwajeet, as i faced a problem while fitting data with some other distribution.


## Assignment2

I did the assignment by myself.

1) I created two dictionaries( male and female) and fetched dataframes from different Excel files to these dictionaries.

2) I tried to plot a few columns using scatter_matrix where i was unable to obtain the graphs for columns with non-real values. Hence i cleaned the data(eg. removing NaN values, converting non-real values to real values). I plotted data for males and females again to see the expected result.

3) I collected the Total Median Income for male and female and plotted it to analyse the comparison race by race. Also plotted line with equal pay of male and females.

4) I fit the data with a line on the plot, then using OLS regression model and obtained the parameters like slope, intercept etc. I used analytical solution as well to obtain the values of beta0, beta1. Again i plotted the analytical solution and regression line to scompare the results.

5) Then I worked with all types of median incomes and followed the same apprroac to obtain a graph with analytical solution, regression line, distribution of all types median incomes for males and females and 'same pay' as well.

6) Observed the data and predicted the female stipend by picking up any stipend value and using OLS regression model.

7) Lastly I analysed the total median incomes of all the races.

## Assignment 3

I worked individually on this and then discussed it with the group( Aaron, Vishwajeet, Achilles, Anastasia).
