##  Assignment_1_Solutions:
I did the Assignment myself by understanding step by step concepts of linemodel fit and polynomial fit. Also Vishwajeet helped me with sorting values while plotting the polynomial fit.

I cleaned the data by removing NaN values and not needed columns.

I followed the further steps from scheleton notebook of the instructor.

I compared the likelihood ratio and was able to conclude the result about the best fit model i.e polynomial fit.
